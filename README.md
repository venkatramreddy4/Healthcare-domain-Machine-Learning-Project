# Healthcare-domain-Machine-Learning-Project
The main purpose of the project is analysing and predicting diabetes using the pima diabetes dataset depending upon preg, age, test etc
Implemented multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier.
Used the 'Pima Indians Diabetes' dataset to classify diabetes outcomes.
Applied 10-fold cross-validation for model evaluation, ensuring robust accuracy comparison across models.
Visualized algorithm performance using box plots to compare accuracy distribution and model consistency.
